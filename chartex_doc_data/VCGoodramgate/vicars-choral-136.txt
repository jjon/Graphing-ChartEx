vicars-choral-136
Notification, in the form of a cirograph, that John Roman canon of York, contemplating divine piety and for the salvation of his soul and the souls of his ancestors, has given the vicars 13s. 4d. from land in Gutherumgate which he bought with his own money (comparavi ex denariis meis), lying next to the messuage of the prebend of Susneubaude and [that] of the prebend of Wistowe; the money is to be paid to the vicars by the canon of the prebend of Wistowe at Martinmas and Pentecost; if the canon of Wistowe fails to pay the money within 8 days of the said terms, the vicars may enter the land and block the door (obstruere ostium) through which there is entry from the house of the canon of Wistowe, and they may dispose of the land as they see best but they may not alienate it. John Roman has also granted to the vicars an annual 10s. which Adam de Sunderlandwic gave him from land in the vill of Garton, payable at the said terms by the succentor and vice-chancellor of the church of York, and to be distributed together with the 13s. 4d. among the vicars and minor clerks of the same church who are present at John's obit. So that the distribution shall be made according to the said proportion, the chapter and the vicars, at John's wish, have excommunicated all who might presume to withhold the rent. Sealed with John's seal and the chapter's seal.
