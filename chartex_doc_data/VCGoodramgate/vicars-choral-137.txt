vicars-choral-137
To all whom the present text will reach John Rom subdeacon of York wishes well. Notification that I have conveyed to God and the Vicars of the blessed Peter a garden next to my house and I made it clear that if the canon who at that time will have the prebend of Wistow wishes to pay a rent to them of 1 mark in the day of my death, as long as he properly pay the said mark every year he will have the said garden; otherwise it will be licit for the said Vicars to close the gate towards the courtyard of the canon and dispose of the garden as they wish. I have also conveyed to the Vicars the house that was of my nephew Peter in Goodramgate with garden and all appurtenances, apart from a fee of 2s to the canon of Wetwang. I have also conveyed to the Vicars 2s that the Jews own me for the garden next to their cemetery. And I also give them in the same way the land just next to the same garden, which I hold of the Chapter of York, apart from the yearly fee to the same chapter of 12d. I made it clear that the fees from all the said properties shall be divided between all the Vicars and clerks who will participate to the office or at least to the mass in the day commemorating my death. And in order of making the said fees permanents I corroborate this text with my seal.
