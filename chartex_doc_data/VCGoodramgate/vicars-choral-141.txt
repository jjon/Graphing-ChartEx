To all faithful in Christ who will read the present text the preaching friars resident in York wish well in God. Notification that we have given, granted and confirmed with the present charter and quitclaimed in perpetuity to the venerable father Lord Walter archbishop of York and primate of England and to his heirs or assigns and their heirs, that land lying between the land of Thomas de Vestiario and land that was of Robert son of Ingolf in Goodramgate, which William son of William son of Sirithe has given us; similarly also land that Robert Ingold held in the same Goodramgate, that Alicia the widow of Nicholas de Bugkethorp had given us, as well as all land that Elen de Puteaco widow of Ade son od Alan gave us in Aldwark, with all appurtenances and without restrictions as it is in the charters of William son of William, Alicia and Elen collected by us about the said lands and that we are surrendering in full to the archbishop; to have and to hold by the said archbishops and his heirs or assigns freely, peacefully and completely as we have and with the same services, so that neither us nor anyone else on our behalf could claim any right in the said lands in perpetuity. We order this charter to be impressed with our seal, so that this agreement will continue to be fixed and stable in the future. Witnesses etc.
