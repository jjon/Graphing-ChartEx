T32	Apparatus 745 1685	[1242 x 1248] SOURCE: VC 3/Vi 4 (205 mm. x 128 mm.) ENDORSEMENT: Carta archiepiscopi quam habuit ab Helena de quietaclamacione quatuor solidorum redditus; Aldewerk: [bundle-mark] .e. SEAL: one tag. COPY: VC 3/1/1, fo. 11v. DATE: The assigned date depends on the identification of W. the treasurer as William de Rotherfield who was dead by April 1242 and on the supposition that Gilbert de Fonton had outlived him rather than left his service while William was still alive, and on the identification of William the succentor as William de Langton alias de Rotherfield, NOTE: See 138. The land from which the rent came is more fully described in 140. The archbishop's steward who heads the witness-list is identifiable as the lawyer William Waddington: J.
