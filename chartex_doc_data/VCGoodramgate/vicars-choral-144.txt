SEAL: tag. COPY: VC 3/1/1, fo.12. DATE: When Spicer was mayor with the bailiffs named here: see 9. NOTE: See 138. Thomas de Kilham, recorded in the endorsement, was alive in 1352, when he was one of the witnesses who answered articles of inquiry relating to the appropriation of the church of Huntington (NR) to the vicars' college. The vicars claimed that the appropriation was necessary because of their poverty, caused by the reduction of rents after the Black Death. Kilham deposed that before the pestilence he used to pay 46s. 8d, for his 'manse', but after it only 26s. 8d. p.a. (VC 3/1/1, fos. 123v.-124).
