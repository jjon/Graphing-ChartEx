It should be know that I have appointed as attorney Lady Alicia who was the wife of Henry de Nevill and her assigns as attorneys of my heirs or assigns to pay yearly to Robert de Barneby and his heirs 6d, half at Pentecost and half at the feast of St Martin in winter, for the land that I held of the said Robert on the corner of Aldwark, as it is fully contained in the charter about the same land that I had from the said Robert. As evidence of that I impress my seal on the present charter.
