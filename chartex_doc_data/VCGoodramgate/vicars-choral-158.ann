T20	Apparatus 623 1675	Warranty. [1235 X 1240] SOURCE: VC 3/1/1, fo. 19. DATE: When Robert de Winchester was precentor (see 532 note). NOTE: This and the next charter relate to rents which the executors of Robert de Winchester assigned, along with other rents, to the vicars as the endowment for an obit: 532. A marginal note written against the cartulary copy of the executors' grant at the point where reference is made to the 7s. 6d. rent reads: M[emorandum?] de Grangia Decani. That is picked up in rent rolls (surviving from the early 14th century) which record under Goodramgate a rent charge of 2s. 6d. a year from the dean's grange. The earliest roll (VC 6/2/5) has an additional note that the rent was by that date assigned to an obit for William de Laneham on 17 April. Laneham, a canon of York and archdeacon of Durham, was alive on 1 August 1244 but dead by 1249 (YMF ii. 9). He died, therefore, on 17 April 1245 x 1249. The 'grange' was presumably a barn belonging to the deanery, which in the Middle Ages stood south-east of the Minster near Holy Trinity church
