vicars-choral-158
Grant by Alan de Katherton knight to mag. Robert de Winton' precentor of York and to his assigns, in return for service and a payment of 7 marks, of a rent charge of 7s. 6d. payable at Pentecost and Martinmas from lands next to the churchyard of Holy Trinity in Gutherumg', lying on the north side of the church between the land of Hugh le Romanger and that of John de Bakenay, namely 5s. from the houses which Ralph Saper holds and 2s. 6d. from the house which Wyth the chaplain once held; mag. Robert and his assigns may distrain for the rent according to the liberties and customs of the city of York. Warranty. [1235 X 1240] SOURCE: VC 3/1/1, fo. 19. DATE: When Robert de Winchester was precentor (see 532 note). NOTE: This and the next charter relate to rents which the executors of Robert de Winchester assigned, along with other rents, to the vicars as the endowment for an obit: 532. A marginal note written against the cartulary copy of the executors' grant at the point where reference is made to the 7s. 6d. rent reads: M[emorandum?] de Grangia Decani. That is picked up in rent rolls (surviving from the early 14th century) which record under Goodramgate a rent charge of 2s. 6d. a year from the dean's grange. The earliest roll (VC 6/2/5) has an additional note that the rent was by that date assigned to an obit for William de Laneham on 17 April. Laneham, a canon of York and archdeacon of Durham, was alive on 1 August 1244 but dead by 1249 (YMF ii. 9). He died, therefore, on 17 April 1245 x 1249. The 'grange' was presumably a barn belonging to the deanery, which in the Middle Ages stood south-east of the Minster near Holy Trinity church.
