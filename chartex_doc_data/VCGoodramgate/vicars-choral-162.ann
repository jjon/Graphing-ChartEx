T31	Apparatus 897 2367	[mid 1250s] SOURCE: VC 3/Vi 104 (185 mm. x 93 mm.). Indented at top. ENDORSEMENT: Invadiacio facia johanni Romano de dorno lapidea; in Godrevngat. SEAL: slit. DATE: Although Gace de Chaumund is not described here as mayor, his precedence before three bailiffs suggests that he was in fact witnessing as that office-holder. See dating note to 61. NOTE: John de Morton called Roman is identifiable as John le Romeyn the younger, who died in 1296 as archbishop of York. He bequeathed the stone house recorded here, as well as land in Layerthorpe, to the vicars. A marginal note against the cartulary copy of the vicars' licence to acquire the property in mortmain, dated 1298, refers to the Goodramgate property as 'great stone houses opposite the Bedern' (note to 268). In 1298 the houses were let to a canon of York, John de Caen, for life (163). The property is identifiable as Camhall or Cambhall, so called by 1332 (VC 3/1/1, fos. 62v. [date], 66v., 67v.) and presumably derived from Caen's name. It occupied a site in Goodramgate adjoining the north side of the Minster Gate, later removed to make room for modern College Street (BIHR, CC. VC. 10, York/CHG 1-8 and York/Goo 62, 66). According to a plan of 1833 the site comprised nos. 24-32 Gobdramgate and nos. 8-12 College Street (BIHR, CC. VC. I I, no. 1). Romeyn's stone house, which stood behind the street frontage, was redeveloped as a courtyard of timber-framed houses in the early 1360s (VC 3/3/29; VC 6/9/1)
