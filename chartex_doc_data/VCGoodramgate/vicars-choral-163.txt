vicars-choral-163
Agreement, in the form of a cirograph, made between the warden and community of vicars and mag. John de Caen canon of York. The warden and vicars, acknowledging the gracious assistance which mag. John has freely given them, have granted him houses in Gotherumgate which were of mag. John Roman formerly archbishop of York who devised them in his will to the vicars and which king Edward, at the instigation of mag. John de Caen, confirmed to them by the charter which the vicars have; the houses shall be held by mag. John for as long as he is a canon of York, and he shall maintain them in the same or better condition as they are now; paying the vicars 40s., at Martinmas and Pentecost. On his departure or death the houses shall revert to the vicars. No other canon of the church shall be able to claim or be obliged in any way in the future by this precedent to acquire the houses at the said value, thereby preventing the vicars from letting them at an increased rent if they wished.
