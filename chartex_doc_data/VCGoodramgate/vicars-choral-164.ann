T24	Apparatus 775 1402	Warranty. Seal. [1256 x 1263] SOURCE: VC 3/1/1, fo. 15v. DATE: When John Mansel was treasurer; before his flight from England in June 1263 (YMF i. 25). NOTE: This and the next two charters and the following final concord form a group, relating to a messuage held of the fee of the prebendary of Wetwang. It was evidently set back from the street, with access through a passage: 165. It adjoined other land of the Same prebend, held by the vicars with similar means of access: 123-5. The messuage granted here was later assigned to the vicars by John Mansel's executors, on the condition that the vicars maintained his obit: 166
