Notification, in the form of a cirograph, that Agnes de Thormoteby has agreed to grant John Maunsel treasurer of York her land in Goderumgate, and that although she has the right of entry to the land during her lifetime acquired through Henry de Percy steward of John Maunsel after the enfeoffment made by her to John, she and her heirs shall not sell any right or claim in the land, so that it may remain with John, his heirs, and assigns for ever. Agnes will pay 1d. annually for the land to John or his heirs at Easter. Agnes appends her seal to John's part of the cirograph, and Adam Cerf, John de Seleby, and other citizens of York have corroborated the present writing with the common seal of the city of York together with her seal.[1256 x1263] SOURCE: VC 3/1/1, fo. 16. DATE: See dating note to 164. NOTE: Agnes de Thormanby ('Thormoteby') is presumably to be identified as Agnes daughter of Alfred of Goodramgate, recorded in 164.
