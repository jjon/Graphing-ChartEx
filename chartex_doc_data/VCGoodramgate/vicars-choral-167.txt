vicars-choral-167
Final concord made in the king's court at York 3 weeks from the day of the purification of blessed Mary 9 Edward I [23 February 1280/1] before John de Wallibus, William de Saham, John de Metingham, and mag. Thomas de Sudington, itinerant justices, between Thomas son of Thomas de York, demandant, and Richard the warden of the house of vicars, deforciant, concerning a messuage in York about which there was an inquest according to the custom of the liberty of St. Peter for tenements within the city of York; Thomas has recognised the right of the warden and his house and has released and quitclaimed the messuage to him, his heirs, and the house. For this recognition, release, quitclaim, fine, and concord the warden gave Thomas 8 marks. SOURCE: VC 3/1/1, fos. 15v.-16. NOTE: See 164. The concord is apparently the consequence of a royal mandate of 13 May 1274 to Ellis de Bekingham and John le Spicer mayor of York to inquire into a complaint made by the vicars that whereas the executors of John Mansel had granted them a messuage in York, they had been ejected by John de Oucer and James of the churchyard (de Cimiterio), who retained the land (Cal. Pat. R., 1272-81, 67).
