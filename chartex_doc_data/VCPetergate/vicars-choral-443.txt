York, Wednesday 1 April 1383, 6 Richard II SOURCE: VC 3/Vi 336 (242 mm. x 92 mm.) ENDORSEMENT: Tenementum T. Waplington, R. Ward. SEAL: slit. NOTE: This and the next sixteen charters form a group. The land granted by Thomas de Waplington to Robert Ward evidently included the messuage which Robert's son John later held at the corner of Petergate and Hornpotlane: 444. In 1417 John Ward granted its reversion to John Watton chaplain and John Malton clerk: 444-6. The reversion probably extended to Robert Ward's Hornpotlane property (252-6), as well as other Hornpotlane property (243-51) and land in Petergate (424-7), all of which seem to have formed an original single block, later sub-divided. In 1417 John Ward's mother Beatrice had a life-interest in the property, which she let to John Wawne: 447-8. The grant of the reversion was subsequently confirmed by John Ward's elder brother Thomas.
